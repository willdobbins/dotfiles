dotfiles
========

Consistant configs between machines - never a bad thing.

- Added .vim & .vimrc to dotfiles.

Pending:
- Emacs configs too.
- Script to auto-symlink all dotfiles (need a forloop that will work on only
  hidden files - don't need README symlinked in ~)
- Script could also easily provide a way to update editor dependencies (just
  git pulling again for new changes)
- Reduce repo size - don't store checked out git repos, just script to clone
  these files to the right locations.
